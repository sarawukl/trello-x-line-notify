# Trello LINE Notify
I'm looking approach to notify all events from Trello to LINE (an instant messaging app that my team use), Then I've found the way to achieve that.

Trello provides webhook for notifying all changes in the Trello model to the third-party application. LINE has notify-bot that receive all trigger from web-service and will send to chat room. This project will be a guideline to create all resources and generate source code that combines two platforms and achieve this goal.
